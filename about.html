        <h5>Welcome to my site for CIS131 with Kirsten Markley.</h5>
        <p>
            Currently, I am 17 years old and enrolled in classes here at OTC though the Career Center, dual credit, and early
            start programs. Most of you probably know me by now, but for those of you who don't I hope to get to know you well
            over the course of this semester. I'm generally a pretty easy going guy. If you ever need help or have any general
            programming questions feel free to send me a message (email, canvas, facebook, TLC Online Tutoring chat room, etc.) 
            and I'll get back with you when I get the chance.
        </p>

                <h1>Love to Cook</h1>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was young not only was I fascinated with comptuers and ocasionally photography, I also had a knack and
                    love for cooking! With me not being home often I got get to cook too many elaborate meals anymore but on the weekends
                    I make some amazing dishes. If I had to pick a favorite dish to make it would probably have to me chinese orange chicken.

                <h1>I'm a tutor!</h1>
                <p>
                    Like I stated above, I'm always open for questions regarding our CIS classes and homework. If you are ever in need
                    tutoring you can drop by the Speakman Tutoring and Learning Center located in ICE212 and if I'm there I'm more than
                    happy to help.

                <h1>Current Obsession</h1>
                <p>
                    Well, I don't own any video game consoles and my computer is not exactly a gaming computer so this only makes
                    my obsessing worse. Right now I've been going crazy over <span class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Nier: Automata's</span> 
                    gameplay, story, and most of all the music. It has some awesome tracks that everyone should check out. It has a
                    little bit of everything game OST wise.
